## Extra Credit Stuff - I think ##
I'm not entirely 100% absolutely sure what the EC question is asking for but I'm gonna give it a good go.
Some features to potentially be added:
* An appearance/reskin system, so you can play the game with different styles of fonts/colorations/animations/etc (some loose theme ideas just off the top of my head: medieval manuscript, retro arcade, fuzzy friends, flower power, etc.)
* Hints maybe? (Perhaps something like: sacrifice 1 guess for a letter that's in the word but no place is given or sacrifice 2 guesses for a letter who's place is given)
* Hardmode/crazymode settings - less guesses, longer words, maybe after about 5-10 secs or so the letters of past guesses start to flutter around the page so if you don't remember what went where you'll just have to take a gamble.

## Some Questions: ##
* What is with the layout and why does it suck? (Seriously I can't figure out how to change this side-by-side nonsense and I hate it.)
* Are you _really_ gonna mark me down 10pts for not working with somebody else?
* Can we change the page title from "Vite App" or is it just... stuck that way?
